#### Command: python manage.py runserver

This is a project submitted as part of Havard University's CS50w online course. 

This web-based application is structured using a Django framework and utilises markdown (.md) files to allow users to create and edit page content. It also features search functionality which handles both partial and accurate search inputs, as well as random page generation.
